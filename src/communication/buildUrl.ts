 * Builds a URL from the passed origin+pathname and search parameters. For example: `https://example.com` and
 * `{ id: 5 }` is converted to `https://example.com?id=5`; while `https://example.com` and `undefined` is left as
 * `https://example.com`.
 *
 * Note that the origin+pathname is used verbatim. The origin is optional and a relative URL can be built by omitting
 * it.
 *
 * As expected by the Mollie API:
 *  * search parameters which are arrays are joined with commas (`{ array: [1, 2] }` becomes `?array=1,2`), and
 *  * search parameters which are objects (but not arrays) are flattened (`{ object: { key: 'value' } }` becomes
 *    `?object[key]=value`).
