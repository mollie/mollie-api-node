Just use the Mollie API to receive payments directly on your website or easily refund transactions to your customers.

## Features

- [Payments](https://docs.mollie.com/reference/v2/payments-api/create-payment): are the heart of the Mollie API: this is where most implementations start off. 
- [Methods](https://docs.mollie.com/reference/v2/methods-api/list-methods): show all the payment methods activated on the website profile. Also allows you to integrate iDEAL's bank selection screen into your own payment flow.
- [Refunds](https://docs.mollie.com/reference/v2/refunds-api/create-refund): allow you to make refunds in relation to a payment.
- [Customers](https://docs.mollie.com/reference/v2/customers-api/create-customer): allow you to manage your customer's details.
- [Mandates](https://docs.mollie.com/reference/v2/mandates-api/create-mandate): allow you to charge a customer's credit card or bank account recurrently.
- [Subscriptions](https://docs.mollie.com/reference/v2/subscriptions-api/create-subscription): allow you to schedule recurring payments to take place at regular intervals.

## Prerequisites

Mollie API client requires Node 4.8.x or higher to be installed.

## Requirements

To use the Mollie API client, the following things are required:

+ Get yourself a free [Mollie account](https://www.mollie.com/dashboard/signup). No sign up costs.
+ Login to your [Dashboard](https://www.mollie.com/dashboard/developers/api-keys) to get your API keys (live and test mode).
+ Now you're ready to use the Mollie API client in test mode.
+ In order to accept payments in live mode, payment methods must be activated in your account. Just follow [a few steps](https://www.mollie.com/dashboard/onboarding) and let us handle the rest.

## Installation

Using [npm](https://npmjs.org/):

```sh
npm install @mollie/api-client --save
```

Or using [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/):
    
```sh
yarn add @mollie/api-client
```

This will add `@mollie/api-client` to your project's dependencies.

You may also git checkout or [download all the files](https://github.com/mollie/mollie-api-node/archive/master.zip), and include the Mollie API client manually.

Check the [releases](https://github.com/mollie/mollie-api-node/releases) page to know which versions are available.

## How to receive payments

To successfully receive a payment, these steps should be implemented:

1. Use the client to create a payment with the requested `amount`, `description`, `redirectUrl` and `webhookUrl` and optionally, a payment `method`. It is important to specify a unique `redirectUrl` where the customer is supposed to return to after the payment is completed.

2. After the payment is completed, our platform will send a request to the provided `webhookUrl` to allow the payment details to be retrieved, so you know exactly when to start processing the customer's order.

3. The customer returns, and should be satisfied to see that the order was paid and is now being processed.

## Authentication

To be able to receive data from the API, an app should authenticate with a bearer token, referred to as API keys.

We've already prepared this step by creating a `test` and `live` key for you in your [Dashboard](https://www.mollie.com/dashboard/).

## Making your first request

Import the client and set your API key

```javascript
const mollie = require('@mollie/api-client')({ apiKey: 'test_dHar4XY7LxsDOtmnkVtjNVWXLSlXsM' });
```

### Create a new payment

```javascript
mollie.payments.create({
  amount: {
    value:    10.00,
    currency: 'EUR'
  },
  description: 'My first API payment',
  redirectUrl: 'https://yourwebshop.example.org/order/123456',
  webhookUrl:  'https://yourwebshop.example.org/webhook'
})
  .then((payment) => {
    // Forward the customer to the payment.getPaymentUrl()
  })
  .catch((err) => {
    // Handle the error
  });
```

### Retrieve a payment

```javascript
mollie.payments.get(payment.id)
  .then((payment) => {
    // E.g. check if the payment.isPaid()
  })
  .catch((err) => {
    // Handle the error
  });
```

That's it!

## Pagination

Fetching all objects of a resource can be convenient. At the same time, returning too many objects at once can be unpractical from a performance perspective. Doing so might be too much work for the Mollie API to generate, or for your website to process. The maximum number of objects returned is 250.

If you want to programmatically browse through a list of objects, use the `nextPage` and `previousPage` methods.

```javascript
mollie.payments
  .all({
    limit: 15
  })
  .then((payments) => {
    // Returns the first 15 payments

    payments.nextPage().then((nextPayments) => {
      // Returns the next 15 payments
    })
  }
```

To retrieve a list of 15 payments, starting with `{ id: 'tr_8WhJKGmgBy' }`, add the first payment ID with the `from` parameter.

```javascript
mollie.payments
  .all({
    limit: 15,
    from: 'tr_8WhJKGmgBy'
  })
  .then((payments) => {
    // Returns the list of payments
    console.log(`First payment on next page will be: ${payments.nextPageCursor}`);
  }
```

## Documentation

To help you get the most out of this client, we've prepared reference documentation, tutorials and other examples that will help you learn and understand how to use this library.

### Guides

For a deep dive in how our systems function we refer to our excellent [guides](https://www.mollie.com/en/docs/overview). These guides provide a complete overview of the Mollie API and cover specific topics dealing with a number of important aspects of the API.

### API reference

This library is a wrapper around our Mollie API. Some more specific details such as query parameters and pagination are better explained in our [API reference](https://docs.mollie.com/reference/v2/payments-api/create-payment), and you can also get a better understanding of how the requests look under the hood.

## Migrating from v1.x

The API client v2.0 was a major rewrite, with some breaking changes. While the basic functionality stayed the same and the method names did not change, some function signatures have changed.
 
See the [migration guide](MIGRATION.md) for more information.
